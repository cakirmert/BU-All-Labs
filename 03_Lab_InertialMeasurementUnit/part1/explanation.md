# Explanation
## The MPU6050 sensor is connected to the Arduino Nano using the I2C interface. The sensor measures acceleration and angular velocity, which are transmitted to the Arduino.
## The Arduino Nano reads the sensor data from the MPU6050 via the I2C bus and sends it to the laptop through a USB connection.
## On the laptop, the Arduino IDE and Serial Monitor are used to compile the Arduino program, upload it to the Arduino, and monitor the incoming data from the sensor.
## This setup ensures that the sensor data is correctly transmitted from the MPU6050 to the Arduino, and then from the Arduino to the laptop for further processing and analysis.
