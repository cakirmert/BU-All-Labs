# What is the accuracy calculated based on the measured data? Why?

## Accuracy: Accuracy can be defined as the closeness of the measured values to the actual value (1 meter in this case). Calculate the difference between the mean measured duration and the expected duration for 1 meter.

# What is the resolution calculated based on the measured data? Why?

## Resolution: Resolution is the smallest change in distance that the sensor can detect. It can be inferred from the granularity of the measurements and the standard deviation.

# What is the quantization calculated based on the measured data? Why?

## Quantization: Quantization refers to the discrete levels at which the measurements are recorded. It can be determined by analyzing the histogram and the unique values in the measurements.
